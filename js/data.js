             at the age of 32. At the Khalifa Stadium in Doha (Qatar), she won the final by some margin,
              breaking clear into an unassailable lead right from the start and crossing the finish line
               in 10.71 seconds. It was a season’s best and the same time she had clocked when winning 
               the World Championships in Moscow six years earlier – just 0.01 seconds slower than her
                personal best. This took her 100m world title haul to four – more than any other athlete in history,
                 male or female, even her illustrious compatriot Usain Bolt (who won three in this distance).  `

    bio: `Michael Phelps owned the world record in the 200-meter butterfly for 18 straight years. And now, 
        thanks to 19-year-old Hungarian swimmer Kristof Milak, it's been broken. Shockingly shattered, actually. <br />
        
        At the FINA world championships Wednesday in South Korea, Milak clocked a time of 1:50.73, shaving .78 seconds off Phelps' world record. <br />
        In his signature event - and the only one he competed in at all five of his Olympic appearances - Phelps first set the record in 2001 as a
         15-year-old, becoming the youngest male swimming to break a world record. He broke his own mark seven times, and most recently, he dropped
          the record time down to 1:51.51 in 2009 before it stood for a decade.

        To put it in perspective, Milak was barely a year old when Phelps first claimed the 200 fly world record. <br />
        Enter Milak, who finished first by an incredible three seconds Wednesday and was about a half a body length
         ahead of Phelps' world record pace when he hit the wall. Japan's Daiya Seto was second with a time of 1:53.86
          and South Africa's Chad le Clos - remember Phelps' nemesis? - was third at 1:54.15. <br />
          
          Phelps won is a four-time world champion in the 200 fly and won four Olympic golds in the event. The only
           Olympic Games he didn't win this event at was his first in 2000 in Sydney, where it was his lone event and he placed fifth.`
